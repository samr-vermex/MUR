Hello. I'm an user interested in your project. The issue I'm having is that when I try to download a comic, the following error appears:

File "C:\Users\samrv\MUR-master\mur.py", line 204, in <module>
    main()
File "C:\Users\samrv\MUR-master\mur.py", line 143, in main
    parse_cookies(cd)
File "C:\Users\samrv\MUR-master\mur.py", line 74, in parse_cookies
    out_cookies[field[5]] = field[6]
                            ~~~~~^^^
IndexError: list index out of range

I wonder if there's a solution for it. I await any response
